  ## Description
  For this week's homework assignment, I created a workout tracker using MongoDB with a Mongoose Schema and all the routing handled by Express

  ## User Story
  As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts.  I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.  I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.  If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance travelled.

  ## Technologies
  MongoDB, Mongo Atlas, Mongoose, Morgan, Express, Javascript, HTML, CSS

  ## Installation
  npm install

  ## Deployed App
